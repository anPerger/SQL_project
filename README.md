# SQL_project

First part of this project consisted of exploring the data to understand what we're working with. After exploration with some basic queries, I began working on the ERD with GenMyModel. This was far and away the most conceptually challenging part for me to grasp, and I spent a long time drawing and redrawing relations between tables to make sure everything was logically consistent and will actually be queryable. After finally getting the schema from my ERD to run correctly and loading in my CSVs I was able to begin querying using JOINS.
